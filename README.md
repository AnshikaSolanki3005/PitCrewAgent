# PitCrewAgent
An Agentic AI System for Real-Time Race Decisioning — a multi-agent reinforcement learning system that analyzes F1 telemetry, weather, and pit-stop data to predict optimal race strategies. It simulates “what-if” scenarios and autonomously recommends real-time pit and tire decisions for better race outcomes.
